## Usage

The files that are used as sample databases can be found in the MIDI toolbox -> src folder. 

This toolbox also has open source files that have functions to read and write MIDI files

Run the Genetic_chopin.m and the Genetic_mozart.m files (depending on which kind of data you want to learn from) using matlab and set the src folder as a path environment variable on your local system

Input: Automatic input of the database

Output: 24 MIDI files, which are sample outputs of the algorithm

The output files will appear in the current directory
