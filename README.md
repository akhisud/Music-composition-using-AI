# Music-composition-using-AI
Generating music compositions using Genetic algorithm, Markov chains and LSTMs

This work was done as part of an undergraduate project in the course 'Artificial Intelligence', during Fall 2015, at BITS Pilani. We used 3 different algorithms separately, each of which would achieve the task of learning to compose music from 2 single-channel datasets: Chopin and Mozart compositions. More information can be found in our project report (Report.pdf). 

Find usage instructions in individual directories. The LSTM-based method's code is yet to be uploaded.
